# NLP Chatbot Using Transformers, FastAPI, and Uvicorn

## Overview  
This repository showcases an advanced NLP-powered chatbot using Hugging Face's `Transformers` library, `FastAPI` for API development, and `Uvicorn` for asynchronous API deployment. The chatbot is designed for query understanding, intent recognition, and seamless API integration.

---

## Key Features  

### üîç **Query Understanding & Intent Recognition**  
- Utilizes Hugging Face `Transformers` for tokenization, contextual embedding, and query processing.  
- Implements pre-trained models like `GPT-2` for Natural Language Understanding (NLU).  
- Supports contextual query handling and fine-tuning for enhanced accuracy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Model Deployment & API Integration**  
- **FastAPI**-based REST API for real-time chatbot interaction.  
- **Uvicorn** server for scalable, asynchronous API deployment.  

### üì° **Secure Public Hosting**  
- **Ngrok** integration for secure public URL access during development.
- Extensible API endpoints compatible with third-party services like **Dialogflow**.
