        "# Clark University SPS Chatbot (Still In Progress)\n",
        "\n",
        "- __Project Objective:__ Develop an AI-powered chatbot for Clark University's School of Professional Studies (SPS) that leverages advanced NLP technologies to enhance student interaction and information retrieval.\n",
        "- __Technology Integration:__ Integrate the chatbot with Dialogflow for natural language understanding and FastAPI for creating a responsive and scalable backend service.\n",
        "- __AI Model Usage:__ Utilize the GPT-2 model, a robust language prediction model, to process and generate human-like text responses based on the trained data.\n",
        "- __Training Data:__ Train the GPT-2 model using a dataset of 10,000 FAQ samples collected from the Clark University website. The system is designed to allow for the integration of additional samples to continually improve response accuracy and relevance.\n",
        "- __Functionality and User Interaction:__ Design the chatbot to answer queries directly related to university processes, academic programs, campus facilities, and more, thereby facilitating an efficient and interactive user experience.\n",
        "- __Scalability and Improvement:__ The chatbot's architecture allows for the ongoing addition of new FAQ samples and further training, ensuring that the system evolves with changing student needs and maintains high accuracy in responses.\n",
        "- __Impact and Benefit:__ Aim to significantly improve the accessibility of information for students and reduce the workload on administrative staff by automating responses to frequently asked questions, with the potential for even greater accuracy as more data is integrated.\n",
        "- __Packages Used:__ transformers, torch, accelerate, fastapi, uvicorn, pyngrok"

It formats the question with specific prefixes to guide the model's response, tokenizes this input, and then uses the model's generate method to produce an answer, controlling the randomness with a specified temperature. This no-gradient operation ensures that the model's parameters are not updated during this process. The generated tokens are decoded into readable text and returned. The function is exemplified with a question about Clark University, demonstrating its practical application in generating conversational responses."
